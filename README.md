# Lung Nodule Classification

**Description:** In a group of 3, we coded a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify lung nodules into either normal, benign, or malignant at UC Santa Barbara Summer Research Academies with 99%+ accuracy. 

**Motivation:**
Lung nodules are typically hard to classify through human eyes, and are very often misdiagnosed, making lung cancer the leading cause of cancer death around the world. To address this, me and my team wanted to create a machine learning model that can act as a second layer of eyes when classifying lung nodules. 

**Technologies:**
Python (PyTorch)
